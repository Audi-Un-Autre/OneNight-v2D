  text: 'Hello friend...

    Today was rather intersting. My new toy got out today... He broke my last bear
    trap with his legs. Why do my toys keep breaking? He tried to steal my trap with
    ''E''. When I found him he tried to run with SHIFT, but he ran out of stamina.
    Then he tried to hide... I be he wished he could escape this reality haha... I
    found it rather funny. I''ll get a new toy soon enough...


    Goodbye friend'
