  text: 'Hello friend,

    The other me has not shown up for days, I wonder if he FINALLY GOT THE MESSAGE.
    I have noticed that you, friend, are missing some pages. HAS HE touched you? HAS
    HE? Enough about him. My new toy has just arrived, but its sick... I''ll wait
    till it feels better to PLAY WITH HIM. Maybe this one wont break as easily as...

    If you find this please run away. I am not sure how much longer i will be able
    to keep hiim at bay. Don''t do anything stupid. Hide if you must! Just stay away
    from him...'
