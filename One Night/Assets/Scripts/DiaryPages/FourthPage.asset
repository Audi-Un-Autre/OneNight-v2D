  text: 'Dear friend,

    What can I call you? Will you be my friend? I''m never alone, but he... he just
    wants to get rid of me. We used to be friends until he started to become violent.
    One day I woke up smelling of blood and dirt and my cat has gone missing... I
    don''t want to ask him or he might...


    DON''T BELIEVE HIM, you are MY FIREND NOT HIS.'
