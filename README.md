# OneNight-v2D

In One Night 2D, you awake to realize you're lost in the woods. But no worries, for there's a house in sight.<br />
On closer inspection, you find that it's actually a mansion of sorts. You knock at the doors, but no response comes. 
You try to enter, yet all the doors are locked. You return to where you woke only to find there's no end to the woods around you. D
o you take your chances getting forever lost in the woods or finding a way inside to the mansion's sanctuary?<br />
Just hurry. Because something's out here. <br />In the woods with you.<br />Watching you.

# Purpose
One Night 2D is a 5 month collaboration between two developers' love of horror games.<br />
Created with Unity's tile system, this project was a return to 2D foundations with the intent of exploring what creates a good horror game. 
We experiment with ambience, atmosphere, lighting, game mechanics, survival horror mechanics, solving puzzles, NPC interaction, and rpg elements.
